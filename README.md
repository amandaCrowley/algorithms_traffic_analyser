# algorithms_traffic_analyser
Use efficient data structures and algorithms to solve problems as provided in assignment 1

This assignment will require students to:
1. Apply specific search algorithms studied in the course to unfamiliar problems.
2. Select appropriate data structures to optimize the performance of the algorithms.
3. Use algorithm analysis techniques to determine the asymptotic complexity of algorithms.

Programming Language: All students are required to use the Java programming language for this assignment.

Marks are provided for functionality and for efficiency (optimising the time complexity of your algorithms). The purpose of these tasks is three-fold: (i) you need to
problem-solve: figure out how best to solve each task, (ii) implement and test the solution, and (iii) determine the complexity of the algorithms used in solving the problems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To test the program add "test" as an arg (in your IDE) this should produce output, as the program is run against the test map provided.

TrafficAssistant.jar: A pre-compiled Java file that contains two classes: MapGenerator and TrafficCheck. These classes are black-boxes, you do not need to know how they work.
When compiling, you will need to ensure this jar file is on the Java classpath. You can use the -cp flag when invoking the Java compiler to set the classpath.

TrafficAnalyser.java: This is where you will complete your assignment, some starting code has been provided to allow compilation.

TrafficMain.java This is the main class to control the program, calling your methods from TrafficAnalyser.java. You may modify this file underneath the marked comment in order to test your code, but the modifications will not be really not part of the assignment.
